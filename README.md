# Nativescript Jitsi Meet

**This plugin is on early version.**

**As soon as the code improves I'll be updating the README as well.**  :wink:

I'll keep working on this plugin as the time pass and our project have more features related to video conference.
If you want to know which are the next things I'll be working on take a look below.

## I'm working on
- Add call listeners to Android such as conferenceTerminated and etc.
- Android is not accepting custom jitsi server yet, only IOS.
- Add core demo version
- Test and add Vue demo version

- In the future I'd like to have more control of jitsi features such as hide invitation button, start call with password and etc. But so far I haven't found if Jisti already have this available on their framework and sdk.

## Prerequisites / Requirements

The only requisites I found necessary so far is that your application may use *android:minSdkVersion **21***;

## Installation

*tns plugin add nativescript-jitsi-meet*

### Android

-

### IOS

In your info.plist file add the follow lines:

```xml

## Angular Usage 
```typescript
import { NativescriptJitsiMeetConferenceOptions, NativescriptJitsiMeet } from 'nativescript-jitsi-meet';

...

public startMeet() {
    const jitsiOptions: NativescriptJitsiMeetConferenceOptions = {
            roomName: 'test',  // the only mandatory field
            audioMuted: false,
            videoMuted: false,
            audioOnly: false,
            featureFlags: {
                closeCaptionsEnabled: false,
                calendarEnabled: false,
                callIntegration: false,
                chatEnabled: false,
                inviteEnabled: false,
                iosRecordingEnabled: false,
                pipEnabled: false,
                welcomePageEnabled: true
            }
    };
    
    const jitsiCaller: NativescriptJitsiMeet = new NativescriptJitsiMeet();
    
    jitsiCaller.on('conferenceWillJoin', (url: string, error: string) => {
        console.log(`conferenceWillJoin`);
    });

    jitsiCaller.on('conferenceJoined', (url: string, error: string) => {
        console.log(`conferenceJoined`);
    });

    jitsiCaller.on('conferenceTerminated', (url: string, error: string) => {
        console.log(`conferenceTerminated`);
    });
    
    // this function will start your meeting;
    jitsiCaller.startMeeting(this.jitsiOptions);
}

...

```

## API 
### NativescriptJitsiMeet

By default the server https://meet.jit.si/ is the default server used by this plugin but you have your own jitsi server you can pass the path on the **constructor** of **NativescriptJitsiMeet**.

**startMeeting**

This function will receive as parameter your options and will start the meet;

**addEventListener**

You can use this function to add your listener to the events listed below. The parameters are the listener name and your callback function. Take a look on the usage above.

**on**

Same as addEventListener, just smaller :)

## Jitsi configuration 
### NativescriptJitsiMeetConferenceOptions
    
| Property | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| roomName |  string, only mandatory property | your room name, keep in mind that if you use this plugin if jitsi default server your room will be always public at the start |
| audioMuted | false | start the meet with the audio muted |
| videoMuted | false | start the meet with the video muted |
| audioOnly | false | start the meet with audio only |
| featureFlags | object | some jitsi meet configuration flags |

**feature flags object properties**

| Feature flags property | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| closeCaptionsEnabled | false | active close caption |
| calendarEnabled | false | ??active calendar |
| callIntegration | false | ??start meet call with call integration |
| chatEnabled | false | start meet with chat enable |
| iosRecordingEnabled | false | enable ios recording video |
| pipEnabled | false | enable pip features |
| welcomePageEnabled | false | enables the jitsi server welcome page, which is not being in use right now because everytime the user close the call we close the view, so this will not be shown by now |
